#

Implements a solution for the producer/consumer issue on a bounded buffer using multiple OS-created threads. 

Demonstrates knowledge of creating threads programmatically, managing those threads, bounded buffers, mutex locks, and data integrity.

Significant portion of code modified/used from Professor Justin Okun of California State University Fullerton, Spring 2017, CPSC 351.

Code meant to be compiled and ran on Ubuntu Mate, i386 32-bit OS.

"Make" creates the executable: bounded_buffer
